Welcome to my little experiment! We all love hearing what our FWM friends are discovering (to our collective wallets' -and partners- dismay), so I thought I'd turn it into a challenge for myself. Because why not? Let's do a blend of our 2025 finest. An infinity bottle of 2025 in a nutshell. The year in a bottle. My challenge? To make sense of it... Or at least to educate myself.

I want to do a deep dive on your whiskies and the distilleries that made them. It's a vehicle for me to hone my Google-fu, learn some web stuff and build my whisky knowledge. Hopefully it's at least in some way entertaining for you to follow along.

So without further ado, here's your FWM 2025 Infinity bottle, in the making...
